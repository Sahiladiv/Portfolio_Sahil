          <p>
            I’m a versatile engineer with a passion for building intelligent, scalable systems that blend the power of machine learning and software engineering. With a strong foundation in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, and cloud platforms like AWS, I specialize in developing end-to-end AI solutions—from model research to deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience spans multimodal learning, generative AI, NLP, and computer vision. I’ve led projects ranging from autoencoder-based photo restoration to trading bots trained with reinforcement learning, and built smart, search-driven platforms using embeddings and LLMs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive at the intersection of deep learning and full-stack engineering—designing systems that are not only innovative, but also robust and production-ready. Driven by curiosity and impact, I’m eager to solve real-world problems through AI-powered software, whether it's optimizing decision-making, enhancing user experience, or pushing the boundaries of what machines can understand.
